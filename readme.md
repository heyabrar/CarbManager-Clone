# What is Carb Management ? 

Carb Manager integrates seamlessly with FitBit, Garmin, and hundreds of other apps and devices via Apple Health and Google Fit, helping you to: Lose weight quickly. Reduce inflammation. Optimize energy. Gain mental clarity. 

This was the website i was assigned to build in the project week. It is an `individual project` build by myself.

I build this project using `React` with fully-featured client and server-side routing library known as `React-Router-Dom`. I have also used `Chakra UI` and `React-icons` to give a good User Interface all over. 

 As it is an individual project i couldn't cover the enitire web clone due to time management. 

 But i have cloned 3 pages of it which you can go through, I have given my best effort to make it look realistic as it is. 

 This project is responsive to all the sceen size's as well. 

 I had a great experience while working on this project. I got to explore a lot more things in React.
